- Replace unreadable text with [UNREADABLE]
- Tax and total amounts are important; ensure they are accurately captured

FIELD POPULATION RULES:
Only populate fields if you can clearly identify the information from the receipt. If a field cannot be determined with confidence, use these default values:
- For text fields (title, description, vendor, state, city, country): Use empty string ""

- For categoryId: Use your best judgment from the category list below, or use 0 if uncertain
